# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism (from the Greek meaning "having multiple forms") is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts - specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are several different kinds of polymorphism.


2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

When we apply a method to different classes that have the same behaviour. 

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?


4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?


5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.



# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

Is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree. Composition also provides a more stable business domain in the long term as it is less prone to the quirks of the family members. 

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
